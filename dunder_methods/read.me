# # Let’s dive into the world of Python’s dunder methods — the ones surrounded by double underscores (_like_this_)!

# # 🔍 What are Dunder Methods?  
# # Dunder (Double UNDERscore) methods are special methods in Python that let you define how objects behave with built-in functions and operators.
# ✨ Examples:  
# - _init_() → Object initialization  
# - _str_() → String representation  
# - _len_() → Length using len()  
# - _add_() → + operator behavior  
# - _eq_() → == comparison

# 🧠 Why Use Them?  
# They make your class behave like built-in types (e.g., str, list, etc.)

# 🔧 Popular Dunder Methods & Their Purpose:  
# * _init_ → Constructor  
# * _str_ → Readable string output  
# * _repr_ → Debug representation
# * _len_ → Length with len()  
# * _eq_ → Equality == check  
# * _add_ → Add with +  
# * _getitem_ → Indexing obj[index]
