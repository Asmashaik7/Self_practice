Class
A class is like a blueprint for creating objects.
It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

Object
An object is an instance of a class.
When you create an object, it has its own data but follows the structure of the class.


class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, marks):
        self.name = name      # instance variable
        self.marks = marks    # instance variable

student1 = Student("Asha", 85)
student2 = Student("Ravi", 92)

print(student1.name, student1.marks)
print(student2.name, student2.marks)
ðŸ“Œ Explanation
âœ… Class â†’ Student (Blueprint for creating students)
âœ… Objects â†’ student1 and student2 (two students created from class)
âœ… Attributes â†’ name, marks (unique data for each object)

ðŸ”¹ Built-in Objects
Python already has predefined classes.

x = 10          # x is object of class int
y = "Hello"     # y is object of class str
z = [1, 2, 3]   # z is object of class list
Here:

int, str, list â†’ built-in classes
x, y, z â†’ built-in objects

ðŸ”¹ What is self?
self represents the current object. It allows each object to store its own data.

Example:

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

s1 = Student("Asha")
s2 = Student("Ravi")

print(s1.name)  # Asha
print(s2.name)  # Ravi
ðŸ‘‰ Without self, Python would not know which objectâ€™s data you are referring to.
It is just a naming convention for the first parameter in any instance method of a class.

ðŸ“Œ What Actually Happens?
When you write:

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
and create an object:

s1 = Student("Asha")
Python automatically calls:

Student.__init__(s1, "Asha")
ðŸ‘‰ Here, s1 is passed as the first argument â†’ stored as self.

ðŸ”¹ Important Points
âœ… self refers to the current object.
âœ… It can be named anything (like this, obj), but by convention we always use self.

Example:

class Student:
    def __init__(object, name):
        object.name = name

s1 = Student("Asha")
print(s1.name)  # Works fine even if we wrote "object" instead of "self"
So, self is not a keyword, not a variable â€“ just the first parameter representing the current object.



âœ…Common Interview Questions
What is the difference between class and object?

What is the use of __init__ method?

What are dunder methods (like __str__, __len__)?

What is the difference between class variables and instance variables?

Explain inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction in Python.

Can you create a small class to represent something (like Employee, Car, Book)?

ðŸ”¹ Class â†’ Blueprint for objects.
ðŸ”¹ Object â†’ Instance of a class.
ðŸ”¹ __init__() â†’ Constructor (runs automatically when object is created).
ðŸ”¹ self â†’ Refers to the current object.
ðŸ”¹ Instance Variables â†’ Belong to each object.
ðŸ”¹ Class Variables â†’ Shared by all objects of that class.
ðŸ”¹ Dunder Methods â†’ Special methods like __str__, __len__, __add__, etc.
ðŸ”¹ OOP Pillars â†’ Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction.
